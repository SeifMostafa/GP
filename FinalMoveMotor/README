after researches we use stepper motor (nema 23 9kg/cm , 4 leads , 56mm square body, 1.8 step-angle)
we use motor to turn the product into the customers who are detected by facedetection algorithm

motor algorithm :
input : angle to turn into 
output : run stepper motor into the exact angle in range 0-180 degree

Thanks!
